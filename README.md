# Prostate-Cancer-Detection
A model to predict Prostate Cancer using malignant and benign labeled MRI images.

we first augment the images at hand with augmentation.
Then we perform feature extraction with DenseNet-121.
With the feature set obtained, we use the SVM algorithm for classification.
The success reaches up to 98.81%.
